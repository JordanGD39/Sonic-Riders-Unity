*Thank you for purchasing my Coconut Palm Tree Package. I hope this pack helps you with your project. 

*There is the 	-Coconut Palm Material folder for the materials
					-inside is the base bark and leaf materials for all the trees and a AFS material if you have AFS to setup the trees
					-also a parts folder which is used in the editable trees
				-Coconut Palm Models folder for the AFS models
				-Coconut Palm Prefab folder for the actual trees
					-there is the AFS folder for setup AFS tree prefabs
					-also a TreeCreatorEditable foler for the original trre creator trees which can be edited
				-Coconut Palm Shaders folder holds the edited tree creator shaders
				-Coconut Palm Texture folder for the base textures
					-inside is the Parts folder that like the parts material folder
					 holds the separate textures of the tree used in the original tree creator trees
				-Demo Scene files folder for misc. scripts and materials


*Some of the textures are from cgtextures.com. Images were edited in GIMP, xNormal, and Blender.

*Tree were created in the Unity Tree Creator.

*Trees have wind animation set up so just add a windzone. Recommend raising the Wind Pulse Magnitude to 1 and the Wind Pulse Frequency to .5.
 There is a nice windzone setup included in the Demo Scene files folder.

*Included in the leaf materials is the diffuse, normal, gloss, and translucency texture. The bark includes the diffuse, normal, and gloss.

*I set up the capsule colliders on the trees so when you have Create Tree Colliders option selected on your terrain you will have
 collision on part of your tree.
 
*In 2.0 I changed the prfabs a lot by moving the mesh separate from the original tree creator and assigning a material for all of them. With this
there is no loss or change of textures when you edit the editable tree. It will only change the mesh. Mainly helps with keeping the shadow texture
to avoid rendering artifacts. The new prefab trees are up front in the prefab folder and the editable trees are in a appropriately named folder behind. 
 
*Also in 2.0 I used the AFS Foliage Tool to create a AFS shader and lightmapping compatible tree from each of the trees.
 So if you have the Advanced Foliage Shader Pack, which I highly recommend if you have not yet purchased it, you can set the AFS material to the 
 Foliage Shader V4 and if you have the AFS script in the scene it will look great and bend nicely. Another thing you do if you have AFS is set
 the bark material to the Nature/AFS Tree Creator Bark Optimized shader and the leaf mateterial to the Nature/AFS Tree Creator Leavers Optimized Shader. 
 Looks better, bends better, and does not have that horrible glossiness in dark scenes.  


Update 1.1
 	*Changed bark texture. If you prefer the original bark texture it is included.
 	*Improved the leaf textures.
 	*Added 2 more trees.
 	*Changed the overall shape of the trees.
 	*Added a gloss map so leaves now have specular effects. If you prefer not to use it just remove the gloss texture from the leaf materials.
 	
Update 1.2
	*New leaf textures.
	
Update 1.3
	*Deleted previous models and created new trees.
	*Changed the leaf texture color.
	*Bark texture improved.
		
Update 1.4
    *Tweaked tree settings.
    
Update 1.5
	*Worked on all textures. New normal textures.
	*Changed some tree settings.
	
Update 1.6
    *Changed the leaf texture.
    *Worked on the leaves settings.
    
Update 1.7
	*Changed the leaf textures and lighting setting.
	*Increased bending values for the trunks. 
	*Set materials from the first tree to all the trees so they share one set of textures. Really helps on performance.
	
Update 1.8
	*Worked on the bark texture. More of a PBS friendly texture. Nice normal added too. Previous textures still included.   
    *Leaf texture alpha and lighting has been changed slightly. 
    
Update 1.9
	*New leaf texture added.
	*Diffuse texture for trees modified to be 2048.
	*Wind settings changed on all the leaves. They now bend more indepentently.	

Update 1.91
	*Unity 5.0 ready!
	*Shadow texture externally edited to match diffuse texture. This will be undone if trees are edited and will
	 result in artifacts showing up in the leaves.
	
Update 2.0 (only for Unity 5 version. Unity 4 version is still 1.91)
	*Lowered the trunk width and increased the flare height to give a smoother lower trunk. This did raise the tri count slightly.
	*Used the AFS Foliage tool to convert the trees to be compatible with the Foliage Shader v4.
	*Created a prefab from each tree separate of the editable tree creator trees. This makes it a little easier and protects from texture change/loss.
	*Included a custom shader for the bark and leaves. Just the normal optimized tree creator that are unhidden and the leaf shader has addshadow 
	 added to protect from leaf artifacts.
	 
Update 2.01
	*Lowered the specularity of the leaves on the treecreator trees texture and lowered the shininess of the leaves on the AFS texture
